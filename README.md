### Solutions for the Winter 2016 assignments of the Stanford CS class on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (CS231n)

In this repo you can find my solutions for the [CS231n course](http://cs231n.github.io/) offered by Stanford on visual recognition. I thought it might be helpful for other fellow students to share them here.

I believe looking at other people's solutions is most beneficial when:
* You're stuck for days on the same assignment and you're actually thinking of quitting the course because you can't get past that tiny little function you have to implement to progress further.
* You want to find out how other people approached the same problem and see if there was a better way to solve an assignment than your current implementation.

Thus, I really hope that you will treat these solutions as your last resort and you will do your best to find the solutions by yourself. This is the best way to learn!

#### Useful things to know
* When doing cross-validation in the first assignment, you might receive some overflow errors depending on what hyperparameters you select. It turns out, [this is expected](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs231n/comments/41noqi/overflow_detected_while_training_linear_svm/) but do let me know if you find a solution to avoid this.

A big thank you to Andrej Karpathy, Justin Johnson and Fei-Fei Li for creating this amazing course. It blows my mind that we live in a time where everyone has free access to courses from one of the best universities in the world. Many thanks also to Clement Thorey for sharing
his solutions as well. They have been very helpful in certain stages of the assignments.
