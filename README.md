### My solutions for the Winter 2016 assignments of the Stanford CS class on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (CS231n)

I am currently taking the [CS231n course](http://cs231n.github.io/) offered by Stanford on visual recognition and I thought it might be helpful for other fellow students to
create a repo where I can share my solutions.

#### Useful things to know
* When doing cross-validation, you might receive some overflow errors depending on what hyperparameters you select. It turns out, [this is expected](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs231n/comments/41noqi/overflow_detected_while_training_linear_svm/) but do let me know if you find a solution to avoid this.
* If you clone this repository, make sure to run 'get_datasets.sh' to get the CIFAR10 dataset.
* You can download the original assignment (without the solutions) on the [course webpage](http://cs231n.github.io/)

A big thank you to Andrej Karpathy, Justin Johnson and Fei-Fei Li for creating this amazing course. It blows my mind that we live in a time where everyone has free access to courses from one of the best universities in the world.
